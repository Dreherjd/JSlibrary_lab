									<p>Sea turtles live in almost every ocean basin throughout the world, nesting on tropical and subtropical beaches. They migrate long distances to feed, often crossing entire oceans. Some loggerheads nest in Japan and migrate to Baja California Sur, Mexico to forage before returning home again. Leatherbacks are capable of withstanding the coldest water temperatures (often below 40˚F) and are found as far south as Chile and as far north as Alaska.</p>

									<p>From the time the hatchlings take their first swim until they return to coastal waters to forage as juveniles may be as long as a decade. This period of time is often referred to as the "lost years" since following sea turtles movements during this phase is difficult and their whereabouts are often unknown. Following the "lost years", when they have grown to approximately the size of a dinner plate, their pelagic (open ocean) phase comes to an end and they return to coastal waters where they forage and continue to mature. During this time, these reptiles are highly mobile, foraging over large areas of ocean. </p>

									<p>Ten to fifty years after hatching (depending on the species), adult sea turtles reach sexual maturity and are able to mate. Once they reach sexual maturity they will migrate to beaches around the world to nest. Only females will come ashore to lay eggs, generally in the area where they were born. Most species will nest several times during a nesting season every 2-4 years over the course of their lifetime. It is not known exactly how long sea turtles live in the wild, but scientists think their life span may be as long as a century. Unfortunately though, turtles face a multitude of threats related to human activities.</p>

									<p>What a sea turtle eats depends upon the species. Some are omnivores, eating a variety of plants and animals, while the hawksbill and the leatherback are specialists, subsisting primarily of sponges (hawksbills) and jellyfish (leatherbacks). Hawksbills for example, are mainly found on and around coral reefs where their main prey sponges are found. Greens forage among seagrass beds and nearshore habitats, and leatherbacks, which are deep divers, are found in pelagic (open ocean) environments where they feed exclusively on jellyfish and other soft-bodied invertebrates that float in the water column.</p>

									<p>Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the water, where not much information can be gathered on their behavior. Most of what is known about sea turtle behavior is obtained by observing hatchlings and females that leave the water to lay eggs. Sea turtles, like salmon, will return to the same nesting grounds at which they were born. When females come to the shore they dig out a nest in the ground with their back flippers, bury their clutch of eggs and return to the ocean. After hatching, the young may take as long as a week to dig themselves out of the nest. They emerge at night, move toward the ocean and remain there, solitary, until it is time to mate.</p>

								<div class="ca-content-text">
									<p>About 1 in 1,000 baby sea turtles will make it to adulthood. They are a source of food for crabs, birds, and other marine animals. However, the biggest threats to sea turtles by far are human related. Oil spills, habitat loss due to development, and entanglement in marine debris such as plastic bags are threats that face many marine animals, but others specifically affect turtles. For example, when sea turtle eggs are incubating, the surrounding temperature affects the sex of the hatchlings, with higher temperatures producing more females. As sand becomes warmer due to climate change, the ratio of females to males becomes out of balance, affecting breeding activities when they reach adulthood. Also, the artificial lighting coming from beachside communities confuses turtles who normally follow the moon and stars’ reflection off the waves to make it back to water, making them more vulnerable to predators, dehydration and roadkill. In some countries, turtle shells are traded on the black market and turtles and their eggs are harvested for food.</p>

								<div class="ca-content-text">
									<p>Most sea turtles migrate between foraging and nesting grounds, and seasonally to warmer waters. Often these migrations take them hundreds and even thousands of miles. With satellite telemetry, scientists can track the movements of sea turtles between areas and even across entire oceans. The leatherback turtle is the record holder, traveling an astounding 10,000 miles or more each year in search of jellyfish, crossing the entire Pacific Ocean from Asia to the West Coast of the US to forage off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California. Sea turtles nest in tropical and subtropical regions around the globe. Both males and females will migrate to nesting areas to breed, generally in the area where they were born. It is not known exactly how adult turtles are able to navigate to their natal (birth) beaches, however, researchers think they may use a number of clues including ocean currents, the earth's magnetic field, and water chemistry.</p>

									<p>Sea turtles around the world are endangered, but you can help bring them back! By supporting our Billion Baby Turtles program, you are helping protect important nesting beaches around the world, ensuring that the hatchlings make it to the water. The funding helps community-based organizations in six countries hire local residents to patrol the beaches and protect the eggs, which in many places are sold illegally on the black market. For every dollar donated to Billion Baby Turtles, we can save at least one endangered hatchling at an important turtle nesting beach around the world.</p>
